# Basic blog

A very simple blog implementation that I learned during a course with Stephen Grider. It uses his public Heroku API to post, fetch and delete simple blog posts. Feel free to create new posts (but keep it clean!) and delete them to test functionality.

###Getting Started###

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
	> git clone git@github.com:erin-commarato/basic-blog.git
	> cd basic-blog
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
